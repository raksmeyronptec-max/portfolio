/**
 * The Education page's view model.

 * The page tells one story — two active degrees feeding one educational
 * mission — and everything it renders is derived here, once, from the CMS
 * rows. Components receive finished values and make no decisions of their own,
 * which is what keeps the spotlight, the week visualisation and the timeline
 * agreeing on the same facts.
 *
 * Isomorphic for the same reason `experience-view.ts` is: no query and no
 * privileged configuration, so types can flow to both sides. Everything on
 * this page renders on the server.
 *
 * ── Programmes and milestones are different things ─────────────────────────
 * The four rows are not four of the same kind. Two are degrees being studied
 * *now*; two are school examinations passed years ago. The old page gave all
 * four the same card, which is exactly how an in-progress bachelor's degree
 * ends up looking like a certificate from 2020. The split is derived, not
 * stored: a current row is a programme, everything else is a milestone.
